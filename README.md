## Matlab Setup to run simulatiom

#### 1. System requirements
To setup and run the simulation you will need a computer running version Matlab 2010a or higher. No special toolboxes are required.

#### 2. Downloading simulation
Download the ZIP of all contents from https://github.com/cunninghamjj/Applying-evolutionary-principles-to-optimize-control-of-mcrpc into a folder of your choice. Once downloaded, unzip the contents and discard the .zip file.

#### 3. Matlab path requirements
Open Matlab and change path the folder with the downloaded files. Then go to File -> Set Path -> Add with Subfolders and select the folder with the downloaded files.

## Running Simulation

#### 1. Setting parameters
This simulation has a multitude of parameters to define the specific simulation to run. Below is the explaination of each of the individual parameters.

###### r: This sets the growth rate for T+, TP, and T- respectively. 

###### k_max: This sets the maximum carrying capacities for T+, TP, and T- respectively. 

###### X_max: The level at which TP cells can sustain a T+ population. At 1.5, each TP cell can sustain 1.5 T+ cells.

###### competitionCoefficients: These values represent the alpha(i,j) in the competition matrix. [1 a b; c 1 d; e f 1]

###### x: Initializes the starting densities for T+, TP, and T- respectively. Currently this sets both T+ and TP at half of their carrying capacities and T- at a very low 0.1.

###### time: Initialized to 1.

###### PSA: Initializes the PSA value to the density of cells present in the initial population.

###### sigmaPSA: The decay rate of PSA out of the system at every simulated time step.

#### 2. Using commenting to design simulation
There are two main selection in the design of the simulation. First is choosing the competition matrix second is choosing the treatment regimen. Choosing T+ most fit or TP most fit will change the underlying competition coefficients and subsequently the dynamics of the game. There are three treatment regimens: 'ADT_Only', 'MaximumTolerableDose_Abiraterone', and 'AdaptiveTherapy_Abiraterone'. 'ADT_Only' simulates only androgen deprivation therapy which is the absence of any abiraterone. MaximumTolerableDose_Abiraterone' first lets the tumor establish itself for 10000 generations before administering abiraterone continuously until the end of the simulation. Lastly, 'AdaptiveTherapy_Abiraterone' using the PSA_GiveABI and PSA_StopABI to define when to administer and when to withdraw abiraterone therapy. PSA_GiveABI and PSA_StopABI can be set at any values to show how changing these effects therapy outcome.

Only one competition matrix should be uncommented and only one treatment regimen should be uncommented.
